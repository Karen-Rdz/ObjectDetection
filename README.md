# ObjectDetection

This repository contains the files that have helped in the realization of the Urban Vlogger project of the research group called "Conscious Technologies" as part of the Campus City initiative of the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. The operation of each will be explained 

## Files
**analysis_objects_csv**: Used to obtain graphs with data from a csv file obtained by running the object detection and tracking algorithm.

**analysis_objects_json**: Used to obtain graphs with data from a json file obtained by running the object detection and tracking algorithm.

**color2bw**: Change a color video to black and white

**count_objects_txt**: Used to obtain graphs with data from a txt file obtained by running the object detection algorithm.

**detect_roads**: Helps detect lanes within a street

**images2video**: From a folder that contains images, create a video

**video2image**: Convert video to images

**write_images**: Create a text file containing a list of image names

**object_tracker**: Object detection and tracking algorithm using YOLO v4 and DeepSort. You must follow the instructions in the following [link](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-deepsort), and use this code instead of the one found by default

**object_tracker_velocity**: Object detection and tracking algorithm using YOLO v4 and DeepSort, with calculations of speed, C02 emissions generated, kinetic energy and power. Follow the instructions in the following link, and use this code instead of the one found by default

**homography**: Algorithm that implements a homography matrix in an image.

**VideoHomography**: Algorithm that implements a homography matrix in video
